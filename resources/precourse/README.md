## Intro to DevOps @ LMTD
## Intersession Work

### About the Next Phase

The goal of our intersession is to give you time to restore yourselves after a successful first sprint into the field of DevOps. Following our Phase 1A you've learned new essential skills in Linux, Python, Git, and AWS.

In this next phase 1B, you will be extending that knowledge into practical projects hosted in the cloud. We will show you more tools and frameworks used in the industry to further your coding ability and computing capacity. But before we throw you into the water again, there are a few TODOs we'd like you each to handle during your time off.

### Your TODOs During Intersession

1. Finish/Review the Linux and Python Essentials on NETACAD

2. Practice at least 12 Python Interview Questions from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/) and/or [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)

3. Make at least 12 git commits on a new full-stack Python application that uses either a Flask or Django backend (serverside),connects to AWS using boto3, and works with some data stored as json (external API request or file-handling).

4. Use our Slack group or the Hangouts chats to stay in touch with the fam and let us all know new things you're working with, getting stuck on, or interested in learning.

### Continuing Your Learning

One good way to extend your knowledge during this break is to learn from the work of your colleagues. We've compiled all of the final projects from the last phase below for folks to learn from. Try your best to read through all of the code and connect with the members of that team for help in the code-review.
